            Doug DeMuro writes articles and makes videos, mainly about cars.
            Doug was born in Denver, Colorado, and received an economics degree
            from Emory University in Atlanta.

            After graduation, Doug spent three years working for Porsche Cars
            North America. Eventually, he quit his job to become a writer,
            largely because it meant that he no longer had to wear pants. Doug’s
            work has been featured in a multitude of magazine publications and
            websites, including Autotrader — where he launched the Oversteer
            enthusiast blog — along with Jalopnik, GQ, and The Week. His YouTube
            channel has hundreds of published videos and has racked up hundreds
            of millions of views.
